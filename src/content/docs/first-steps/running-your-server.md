description: How to start your server

To run the server you will need to either create a startup script or run a command in your terminal.

You can generate a startup script using [PaperMC's Startup Script Generator](https://docs.papermc.io/misc/tools/start-script-gen).

You can also obtain the optimized terminal command to run the server there.

Ensure you navigated your terminal to the directory of your server and that you have replaced `icecream-(version).jar` with the name of the jar you have downloaded.

The amount of RAM can be set by changing the numbers in the `-Xms` and `-Xmx` arguments.

`--nogui` disables Vanilla's GUI, so you don't get double interfaces when using the command line.

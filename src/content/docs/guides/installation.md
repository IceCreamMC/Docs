**⚠️ WARNING** Please note that we're still in development and running IceCreamMC is a bad idea on a big server!

### Installing From Scratch on any server
1. Make Your Server Make Sure It Has Java On It
2. Download the IceCream server jar from Github or our Website
3. Upload the jar
4. Rename the jar to what your servers startup (ex. server.jar)
5. Start your server
6. Enjoy!


### Docker
COMING SOON!
